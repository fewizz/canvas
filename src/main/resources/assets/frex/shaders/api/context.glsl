  Definitions to indicate operating mode of renderer.
  Typical usage is to control conditional compilation of
  features that may not work or work differently in,
  for example, GUI vs world rendering.

// If not present, lightmaps and other vanilla-specific data will not be valid or may not present.
// Access to vanilla lighting data should be guarded by #ifdef on this constant.
// Controlled by the active pipeline.
#define VANILLA_LIGHTING

// present in world context only when feature is enabled - if not present then foliage shaders should NOOP
#define ANIMATED_FOLIAGE


// Will define VERTEX_SHADER or FRAGMENT_SHADER - useful for checks in common libraries
// #define VERTEX_SHADER

// present only when pipeline support the feature and it is enabled
#define SHADOW_MAP_PRESENT

// present when material shaders are being run to generate a shadow map or depth math
//#define DEPTH_PASS
